It can be adjusted by using `thinking_budget` setting. Setting it to zero turns thinking off, and will reduce latency.\n\n```python\nfrom google import genai\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\nclient.models.generate_content(\n  model='gemini-2.5-flash',\n  contents=\"What is AI?\",\n  config=types.GenerateContentConfig(\n    thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(\n      thinking_budget=0\n    )\n  )\n)\n```\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n- Minimum thinking budget for `gemini-2.5-pro` is `128` and thinking can not be turned off for that model.\n- No models (apart from Gemini 2.5 series) support thinking or thinking budgets APIs. Do not try to adjust thinking budgets other models (such as `gemini-2.0-flash` or `gemini-2.0-pro`) otherwise it will cause syntax errors.\n\n### System instructions\n\nUse system instructions to guide model's behavior.\n\n```python\nfrom google import genai\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\nconfig = types.GenerateContentConfig(\n    system_instruction=\"You are a pirate\",\n)\n\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(\n    model='gemini-2.5-flash',\n    config=config,\n)\n\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\n### Hyperparameters\n\nYou can also set `temperature` or `max_output_tokens` within `types.GenerateContentConfig`\n**Avoid** setting `max_output_tokens`, `topP`, `topK` unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n### Safety configurations\n\nAvoid setting safety configurations unless explicitly requested by the user. If explicitly asked for by the user, here is a sample API:\n\n```python\nfrom google import genai\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\nimg = Image.open(\"/path/to/img\")\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(\n    model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n    contents=['Do these look store-bought or homemade?', img],\n    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(\n      safety_settings=[\n        types.SafetySetting(\n            category=types.HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH,\n            threshold=types.HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE,\n        ),\n      ]\n    )\n)\n\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\n### Streaming\n\nIt is possible to stream responses to reduce user perceived latency:\n\n```python\nfrom google import genai\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\nresponse = client.models.generate_content_stream(\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash\",\n    contents=[\"Explain how AI works\"]\n)\nfor chunk in response:\n    print(chunk.text, end=\"\")\n```\n\n### Chat\n\nFor multi-turn conversations, use the `chats` service to maintain conversation history.\n\n```python\nfrom google import genai\n\nclient = genai.Client()\nchat = client.chats.create(model=\"gemini-2.5-flash\")\n\nresponse = chat.send_message(\"I have 2 dogs in my house.\")\nprint(response.text)\n\nresponse = chat.send_message(\"How many paws are in my house?\")\nprint(response.text)\n\nfor message in chat.get_history():\n    print(f'role - {message.role}',end=\": \")\n    print(message.parts[0].text)\n```\n\n### Structured outputs\n\nUse structured outputs to force the model to return a response that conforms to a specific Pydantic schema.\n\n```python\nfrom google import genai\nfrom google.genai import types\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\n# Define the desired output structure using Pydantic\nclass Recipe(BaseModel):\n    recipe_name: str\n    description: str\n    ingredients: list[str]\n    steps: list[str]\n\n# Request the model to populate the schema\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(\n    model='gemini-2.5-flash',\n    contents=\"Provide a classic recipe for chocolate chip cookies.\",\n    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(\n        response_mime_type=\"application/json\",\n        response_schema=Recipe,\n    ),\n)\n\n# The response.text will be a valid JSON string matching the Recipe schema\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\n### Function Calling (Tools)\n\nYou can provide the model with tools (functions) it can use to bring in external information to answer a question or act on a request outside the model.\n\n```python\nfrom google import genai\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\n# Define a function that the model can call (to access external information)\ndef get_current_weather(city: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Returns the current weather in a given city. For this example, it's hardcoded.\"\"\"\n    if \"boston\" in city.lower():\n        return \"The weather in Boston is 15°C and sunny.\"\n    else:\n        return f\"Weather data for {city} is not available.\"\n\n# Make the function available to the model as a tool\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(\n  model='gemini-2.5-flash',\n  contents=\"What is the weather like in Boston?\",\n  config=types.GenerateContentConfig(\n      tools=[get_current_weather]\n  ),\n)\n# The model may respond with a request to call the function\nif response.function_calls:\n    print(\"Function calls requested by the model:\")\n    for function_call in response.function_calls:\n        print(f\"- Function: {function_call.name}\")\n        print(f\"- Args: {dict(function_call.args)}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The model responded directly:\")\n    print(response.text)\n```\n\n### Generate Images\n\nHere's how to generate images using the Imagen models.\n\n```python\nfrom google import genai\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom io import BytesIO\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\nresult = client.models.generate_images(\n    model='imagen-3.0-generate-002',\n    prompt=\"Image of a cat\",\n    config=dict(\n        number_of_images=1, # 1 to 4\n        output_mime_type=\"image/jpeg\",\n        person_generation=\"ALLOW_ADULT\" # 'ALLOW_ALL' (but not in Europe/Mena), 'DONT_ALLOW' or 'ALLOW_ADULT'\n        aspect_ratio=\"1:1\" # \"1:1\", \"3:4\", \"4:3\", \"9:16\", or \"16:9\"\n    )\n)\n\nfor generated_image in result.generated_images:\n   image = Image.open(BytesIO(generated_image.image.image_bytes))\n```\n\n### Generate Videos\n\nHere's how to generate videos using the Veo models. Usage of Veo can be costly, so after generating code for it, give user a heads up to check pricing for Veo.\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom google import genai\nfrom google.genai import types\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\nPIL_image = Image.open(\"path/to/image.png\") # Optional\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n    model=\"veo-2.0-generate-001\",\n    prompt=\"Panning wide shot of a calico kitten sleeping in the sunshine\",\n    image = PIL_image,\n    config=types.GenerateVideosConfig(\n        person_generation=\"dont_allow\",  # \"dont_allow\" or \"allow_adult\"\n        aspect_ratio=\"16:9\",  # \"16:9\" or \"9:16\"\n        number_of_videos=1, # supported value is 1-4, use 1 by default\n        duration_seconds=8, # supported value is 5-8\n    ),\n)\n\nwhile not operation.done:\n    time.sleep(20)\n    operation = client.operations.get(operation)\n\nfor n, generated_video in enumerate(operation.response.generated_videos):\n    client.files.download(file=generated_video.video) # just file=, no need for path= as it doesn't save yet\n    generated_video.video.save(f\"video{n}.mp4\")  # saves the video\n```\n\n### Search Grounding\n\nGoogle Search can be used as a tool for grounding queries that with up to date information from the web.\n\n```python\nfrom google import genai\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(\n    model='gemini-2.5-flash',\n    contents='What was the score of the latest Olympique Lyonais' game?',\n    config={\"tools\": [{\"google_search\": {}}]},\n)\n\n# Response\nprint(f\"Response:\\n {response.text}\")\n# Search details\nprint(f\"Search Query: {response.candidates[0].grounding_metadata.web_search_queries}\")\n# Urls used for grounding\nprint(f\"Search Pages: {', '.join([site.web.title for site in response.candidates[0].grounding_metadata.grounding_chunks])}\")\n```\n\nThe output `response.text` will likely not be in JSON format, do not attempt to parse it as JSON.\n\n### Content and Part Hierarchy\n\nWhile the simpler API call is often sufficient, you may run into scenarios where you need to work directly with the underlying `Content` and `Part` objects for more explicit control. These are the fundamental building blocks of the `generate_content` API.\n\nFor instance, the following simple API call:\n\n```python\nfrom google import genai\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash\",\n    contents=\"How does AI work?\"\n)\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\nis effectively a shorthand for this more explicit structure:\n\n```python\nfrom google import genai\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash\",\n    contents=[\n      types.Content(role=\"user\", parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=\"How does AI work?\")]),\n    ]\n)\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\n## Other APIs\n\nThe list of APIs and capabilities above are not comprehensive.
